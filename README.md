My solution for Chapter 3 Exercise 4 of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Problem Description:
Write a program that reads one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The words 
should be output one per line. A word is defined to be a sequence of letters. Any
characters in the input that are not letters should be discarded. For example, if the user
inputs the line
He said, "That’s not a good idea."
then the output of the program should be:
He
said
That
s
not
a
good
idea
An improved version of the program would list “that’s” as a single word. An apostrophe
can be considered to be part of a word if there is a letter on each side of the apostrophe.
To test whether a character is a letter, you might use (ch >= ’a’ && ch <= ’z’) ||
(ch >= ’A’ && ch <= ’Z’). However, this only works in English and similar languages.
A better choice is to call the standard function Character.isLetter(ch), which returns
a boolean value of true if ch is a letter and false if it is not. This works for any Unicode
character.


Notes: TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
